# Design Decisions

This document outlines the architectural decisions, technologies used, and the reasoning behind the design choices for the **Employee Insights API**.

## Overview

The project is a REST API built using **Flask** that enables managing employee data, including CRUD operations, task and project management, performance tracking, data export, and data visualization. The API is designed to be secure, scalable, and easily extendable.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with Python. It provides a minimalistic setup while still being powerful enough to handle complex tasks.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful ORM used to interact with the database. It abstracts the SQL layer and allows for easy querying and data manipulation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the database to store employee data. PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries.
- **Swagger UI**: For generating interactive API documentation. It allows developers to easily test and explore the API endpoints.
- **Flask-Cors**: To handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and make the API accessible from different domains.
- **Flask-Dotenv**: To manage environment variables and keep configuration settings secure and flexible.

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Microservice Design**:  
   The API is designed as a small microservice that manages employee-related data. It adheres to the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion by isolating the employee management features into distinct routes and models.
   
2. **Authentication**:  
   Basic Authentication is implemented for securing the API. This is suitable for simple use cases but can be extended to OAuth or JWT tokens for more robust security in production.
   
3. **Data Models**:  
   The data models are designed to represent employees, tasks, projects, and performance reviews. Relationships between these models are established using SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities, making it easier to fetch related data using SQLAlchemy's querying syntax.

4. **Visualization**:  
   We integrated Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and testing. It allows API consumers to quickly understand the endpoints and test them without using external tools like Postman.

5. **Testing**:  
   The API is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, ensuring that new features can be added with minimal changes to the existing structure. Unit testing and integration testing should be added for production-grade applications.

6. **Swagger UI**:  
   The inclusion of Swagger UI provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring and testing the API. The interactive documentation is generated using **Flask-RESTPlus** and **Flask-Swagger-UI**, ensuring that all API endpoints are well-documented and accessible.

7. **Deployment**:  
   The application can be easily deployed by running the Flask app locally or via a Dockerized environment (though Docker is optional in this case). The configuration for PostgreSQL, environment variables, and application parameters is handled via the `.env` file.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
   
- **Authentication**:  
   Implementing Basic Authentication was straightforward. However, future improvements include switching to OAuth2 or JWT for more secure and scalable authentication.

- **Pagination**:  
   Handling large datasets required the addition of pagination to API responses. This ensures that clients can retrieve data in manageable chunks, preventing performance issues.

## Future Improvements

- **Authentication Enhancement**: Switch to JWT or OAuth2 for token-based authentication.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use **Celery** for background task processing, especially for long-running tasks like data generation and report export.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Write tests to ensure the API works as expected and is production-ready.
